## 1. Performance Optimization Techniques

The performance optimization documentation covers both application-level and infrastructure-level strategies, including:
- Caching mechanisms such as in-memory caching and Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)
- Database optimization techniques including indexing, query optimization, and connection pooling
- Load balancing and scaling strategies, highlighting horizontal and vertical scaling
- Code optimization best practices such as efficient algorithms, reducing dependencies, and asynchronous processing

These techniques collectively improve application speed, reliability, scalability, and user experience.
