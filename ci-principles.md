# Continuous Integration Principles

## Overview
Continuous Integration (CI) is a software development practice where developers
frequently integrate code changes into a shared repository. Each integration is
automatically built and tested to detect issues early.

## Core Principles of Continuous Integration
- Frequent commits to a shared repository
- Automated builds triggered on code changes
- Automated testing to validate changes
- Fast feedback to developers
- Early detection of integration issues

## Benefits of Continuous Integration
- Reduces integration conflicts
- Detects bugs early in the development process
- Improves software quality
- Speeds up development cycles
- Increases team confidence in code changes

## CI and Collaboration
CI improves collaboration by ensuring all developers work with the latest codebase.
Automated pipelines notify the team immediately when a build or test fails.

Example:
If one developer introduces a breaking change, CI alerts the team before the code
is merged, preventing conflicts and misunderstandings.

## CI and Code Quality
CI improves code quality by enforcing automated testing and build validation on
every commit.

Example:
Unit tests and static analysis tools in a CI pipeline catch errors early, ensuring
only stable and tested code is merged into the main branch.
