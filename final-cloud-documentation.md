# Final Cloud Computing Documentation

## 1. Cloud Service Models

Cloud computing offers different service models depending on the level of control and management:

### a. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

* Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet.
* Examples: AWS EC2, Azure Virtual Machines, Google Compute Engine.
* Pros: Flexible, scalable, pay-as-you-go pricing.
* Cons: Requires management of OS, storage, and networking.

### b. Platform as a Service (PaaS)

* Provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without managing infrastructure.
* Examples: AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Azure App Service, Google App Engine.
* Pros: Simplifies development, reduces management overhead.
* Cons: Less control over underlying infrastructure.

### c. Software as a Service (SaaS)

* Delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis.
* Examples: Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, Salesforce.
* Pros: Easy to use, accessible from anywhere, no installation needed.
* Cons: Limited customization, reliant on vendor availability.

## 2. Cloud Types

Cloud environments vary based on deployment and accessibility:

### a. Public Cloud

* Offered by third-party providers and accessible over the internet.
* Examples: AWS, Azure, Google Cloud.
* Pros: Cost-effective, highly scalable, no infrastructure maintenance.
* Cons: Security concerns, less control over resources.

### b. Private Cloud

* Dedicated cloud infrastructure for a single organization.
* Examples: VMware, OpenStack.
* Pros: Enhanced security and control.
* Cons: Higher costs, requires in-house management.

### c. Hybrid Cloud

* Combines public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to move between them.
* Pros: Flexibility, optimized workload distribution.
* Cons: Complex management, integration challenges.

### d. Multi-Cloud

* Uses services from multiple cloud providers to avoid vendor lock-in.
* Pros: Redundancy, optimized performance.
* Cons: Increased management complexity.

## 3. Benefits of Cloud in DevOps

Cloud computing enhances DevOps practices by offering:

* **Scalability:** Dynamically adjust resources to meet workload demands.
* **Continuous Integration/Delivery (CI/CD):** Automate deployment pipelines.
* **Collaboration:** Teams can access shared resources globally.
* **Cost Efficiency:** Pay-as-you-go pricing reduces capital expenses.
* **Disaster Recovery:** Cloud backups ensure business continuity.
* **Monitoring & Logging:** Built-in cloud tools improve system visibility.

## 4. Tools Overview

### a. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

* Automates provisioning and management of cloud resources.
* Examples: Terraform, AWS CloudFormation, Ansible.

### b. CI/CD Tools

* Automate code integration, testing, and deployment.
* Examples: Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, Azure DevOps Pipelines.

### c. Monitoring & Logging

* Track system health and troubleshoot issues.
* Examples: Prometheus, Grafana, CloudWatch, Stackdriver.

### d. Containerization & Orchestration

* Package applications and manage containerized workloads.
* Examples: Docker, Kubernetes, ECS, AKS, GKE.

### e. Collaboration & Management Tools

* Enhance team productivity and cloud governance.
* Examples: Jira, Confluence, Slack, Terraform Cloud.
