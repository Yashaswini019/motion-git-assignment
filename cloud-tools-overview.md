# Cloud Tools Overview: AWS, Azure, and GCP

Modern cloud platforms provide a rich set of tools that support **DevOps practices** such as automation, continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD), infrastructure as code, monitoring, and scalability. This document provides an overview of key DevOps-relevant services offered by **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**, **Microsoft Azure**, and **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**.

## Amazon Web Services (AWS)

AWS is a widely adopted cloud platform offering a broad range of services that support DevOps automation, scalability, and reliability.

### Key DevOps Services

* **Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**
  Provides scalable virtual machines used to host applications, build servers, and deployment environments.

* **Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)**
  Object storage service used for storing build artifacts, logs, backups, and static assets.

* **AWS Lambda**
  Serverless compute service that allows execution of code without managing servers, commonly used for event-driven automation.

* **AWS CloudFormation**
  Infrastructure as Code (IaC) service that enables teams to define and provision AWS infrastructure using templates.

* **AWS CodePipeline**
  Automates build, test, and deployment workflows for continuous delivery.

### DevOps Benefits

* Fully managed CI/CD tools
* High scalability and availability
* Strong automation and monitoring ecosystem

## Microsoft Azure

Azure provides integrated DevOps services and strong enterprise tooling, making it suitable for organizations using Microsoft technologies.

### Important Services and Tools

* **Azure DevOps**
  A complete DevOps toolchain including Repos, Pipelines, Boards, Test Plans, and Artifacts.

* **Azure Functions**
  Serverless computing service for running event-driven code with automatic scaling.

* **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**
  Managed Kubernetes service for containerized application deployment and orchestration.

* **Azure App Service**
  Platform as a Service (PaaS) for hosting web applications and APIs.

* **Azure Resource Manager (ARM)**
  Infrastructure as Code framework for deploying and managing Azure resources.

### DevOps Benefits

* End-to-end DevOps lifecycle management
* Seamless integration with GitHub
* Strong enterprise security and compliance support

## Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

GCP is known for its strength in containerization, data processing, and developer-friendly DevOps tools.

### Significant Services

* **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)**
  Managed Kubernetes service optimized for container orchestration and scalability.

* **Cloud Functions**
  Serverless platform for executing event-driven functions without server management.

* **Cloud Build**
  Continuous integration service that builds, tests, and deploys applications.

* **Cloud Source Repositories**
  Git-based source code repositories integrated with GCP services.

* **Deployment Manager**
  Infrastructure as Code tool for defining and deploying cloud resources.

### DevOps Benefits

* Fast and reliable CI/CD pipelines
* Deep Kubernetes and container support
* Strong automation and monitoring capabilities
